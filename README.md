## üöÄ Getting Started

There are two ways to start building with Flexrr:

### Option 1: Use Flexrr Studio (Recommended)

Flexrr Studio streamlines the setup process by automating repository creation and configuration:

1. Visit [Flexrr Studio](https://flexrr-studio.vercel.app)
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Create a new project
4. Configure your project settings (you'll need to set up your own MongoDB and Supabase accounts)
5. Flexrr Studio will clone the template, set up the repository, and provide you with environment variables ready to use for deployment

*Note: Flexrr Studio simplifies the initial setup process, but you'll still need to create and configure your own MongoDB Atlas database and Supabase project.*

### Option 2: Manual Setup

For direct control over the setup process:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/octagonemusic/flexrr.git my-project
   cd my-project
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env.local` file with your configuration:
   ```
   # MongoDB (Required for Payload CMS)
   DATABASE_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/database
   
   # Application Secret
   PAYLOAD_SECRET=your-secure-secret-here
   
   # Supabase Storage (For media uploads)
   S3_BUCKET=your-bucket-name
   S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-supabase-anon-key
   S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-supabase-service-role-key
   S3_REGION=your-region
   S3_ENDPOINT=https://your-project-id.supabase.co/storage/v1
   
   # Site URL
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view your site
6. Open [http://localhost:3000/admin](http://localhost:3000/admin) to access the Payload CMS admin panel

## ‚öôÔ∏è Required Services

Flexrr integrates with the following external services:

### 1. MongoDB Atlas

Payload CMS requires MongoDB as its database:
- Create an account at [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
- Create a new cluster
- Configure database access (username/password)
- Get your connection string and add it to `.env.local` as `DATABASE_URI`

### 2. Supabase (Recommended for Storage)

For media storage, we recommend Supabase:
- Create an account at [Supabase](https://supabase.com)
- Create a new project
- Set up a storage bucket with appropriate permissions
- Get your API keys from the project settings
- Configure the storage keys in your `.env.local` file

### 3. Vercel (Recommended for Hosting)

For deployment, we recommend Vercel:
- Create an account at [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
- Connect your GitHub repository
- Configure the environment variables from your `.env.local`
- Deploy your project

## üñ•Ô∏è Payload CMS

Flexrr leverages Payload CMS to provide a powerful content management experience:

### Admin Panel

Access the admin panel at `/admin` to:
- Create and manage content
- Upload and organize media
- Manage users and permissions
- Configure site settings

### Content Modeling

Flexrr includes pre-configured content models for common content types:
- Pages
- Blog posts
- Navigation menus

You can easily customize these models or create new ones by modifying the collection files in the `/payload/collections` directory.

### Blocks-Based Editing

Create dynamic page layouts using the built-in block editor, which includes:
- Rich text blocks
- Image and gallery blocks
- Call-to-action blocks
- Feature blocks
- Testimonial blocks
- And more!

## üîß Configuration Guide

5. Get your connection string in the format: `mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/database`
6. Add it to your `.env.local` file as `DATABASE_URI`

### Supabase Storage Setup

1. Create a [Supabase](https://supabase.com) account
